### Explicit exclusions

## Build checks

- PASS — settings form_id/version present and preserved
- PASS — no reserved generated-name collisions
- PASS — source node names globally unique
- PASS — commitment recipe ordering matches generated canonical commitment
- PASS — NFC credential + PIN + issuer-signature cryptographic authentication wrapper injected
- PASS — generated field authentication does not require a caller-editable issuer whitelist
- PASS — full issuer fingerprint and NFC verification-evidence hash are bound into the frozen ODK commitment
- PASS — study issuer/credential authorisation is declared as central reconciliation
- PASS — source user-interface fields gated on authentication
- PASS — source editable fields become read-only after finalization
- PASS — frozen ODK commitment/hash + live integrity reconstruction injected
- PASS — prior NFC execution reuse attestation injected
- PASS — final required submission guard injected

## Warnings

- 1 field(s) are explicitly excluded from the attested commitment: display_language

## Known v0.1 limitations

- Repeat groups must be explicitly excluded (`mm_commit=exclude` on `begin_repeat`).
- Binary/media fields cannot yet be content-hashed by this compiler; explicitly exclude them for now.
- Global duplicate survey node names are rejected in v0.1.
- The compiler does not replace pyxform/ODK Validate. Upload/validate the generated release form before deployment.

## Release rule

Treat the ordinary source XLSForm as the authoring source of truth. Do not hand-edit the generated MethodMesh release workbook; rebuild it from source.
