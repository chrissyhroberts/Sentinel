### Committed fields

| Order | Field | XLSForm type | Mode | Transform |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `participant_id` | `text` | `sha256` | `odk-lexical-utf8-sha256` |
| 2 | `visit_date` | `date` | `value` | `yyyy-mm-dd` |
| 3 | `systolic_bp` | `integer` | `value` | `odk-canonical-scalar` |
| 4 | `clinical_outcome` | `select_one outcome` | `value` | `stored-choice-name` |
| 5 | `symptoms` | `select_multiple symptoms` | `sha256` | `odk-selection-order-lexical-utf8-sha256` |
| 6 | `clinical_notes` | `text` | `sha256` | `odk-lexical-utf8-sha256` |

### Explicit exclusions

- `display_language`

## Build checks

- PASS — exact source XLSForm copied into release bundle and source SHA-256 preserved
- PASS — settings form_id preserved and release version generated once at compile time
- PASS — no reserved generated-name collisions
- PASS — source node names globally unique
- PASS — commitment recipe ordering matches generated canonical commitment
- PASS — NFC+PIN authentication wrapper injected
- PASS — source user-interface fields gated on authentication
- PASS — source editable fields become read-only after finalization
- PASS — frozen ODK commitment/hash + live integrity reconstruction injected
- PASS — prior NFC execution reuse attestation injected
- PASS — final required submission guard injected
- PASS — release bundle receives an integrity checksum inventory

## Warnings

- 1 field(s) are explicitly excluded from the attested commitment: display_language

## Known v0.3 limitations

- Repeat groups must be explicitly excluded (`mm_commit=exclude` on `begin_repeat`).
- Binary/media fields cannot yet be content-hashed by this compiler; explicitly exclude them for now.
- Global duplicate survey node names are rejected.
- The compiler does not replace pyxform/ODK Validate. Upload/validate the generated release form before deployment.

## Release rule

Treat the preserved ordinary source XLSForm as the authoring source of truth. Do not hand-edit the generated MethodMesh release workbook; rebuild from source.
The compiler owns the deployed form version: every build writes one local-time `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` value into both `settings.version` and the attested `mm_form_version`.
Every build is placed in a new release folder. Existing release folders are never overwritten.
